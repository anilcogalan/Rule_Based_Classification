Business Problem

A game company wants to create level-based new customer definitions (personas) using some features of its customers, create segments according to these new customer definitions, and estimate how much the new customers can earn on average according to these segments.


Dataset Story

The Persona.csv dataset contains the prices of the products an international game company sells and some demographic information about the users who buy these products. The data set consists of records created in each sales transaction. Thus, the table is not deduplicated. In other words, a user with specific demographic characteristics may have made multiple purchases.

Price: The amount the customer spends 
Source: The type of device the customer is connecting to
 Sex: The gender of the customer 
Country: The country of the customer
 Age: The age of the customer
